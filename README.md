# Rock-Paper-Sissor.py

This code utilizes the Tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for the game. It creates three buttons representing the choices: Rock, Paper, and Scissors. When a button is clicked, the play_game() function is called with the corresponding choice, and the result is displayed in a message box.

You can run this code in a Python interpreter or save it as a .py file and execute it using a Python interpreter to play the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using a GUI.
